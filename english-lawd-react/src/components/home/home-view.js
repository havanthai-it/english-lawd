        The project needs another important addition: a utilities directory. This is a folder full of helper functions that are used globally. Keep your code DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) by exporting repeated logic to a singular location and importing it where used. Parts of your application can now share logic without copy-pasting by placing shared logic in this utilities directory.
